about-text:

<div class="w-50-l fl pr5-l measure">
Open source software is a critical component of many public interest technologies. However, running a sustainable open source project is about more than good code. Projects need support beyond software development throughout their lifetimes. Across industries, people are working to reimagine systems that allow ideas and data to flow freely, but these groups work in isolation. There is a clear need for services and supportive community spaces to set conditions for success and develop leaders in open source projects across domains.
