about:

Code for Science & Society (CS&S) is building a global network of projects and people who build open source, public interest technology. We bring people together from across open source communities. We create inclusive community spaces for people to share knowledge and support one another. We provide fiscal sponsorship and strategic project development. We support communities creating innovative, open, and decentralized applications for research, civic, and creative use. We work with these groups to push existing boundaries, develop innovative tools, create community resources, and revamp collaborative processes to solve common problems. 
 
We believe in the power of people working together to eliminate information silos and advance knowledge.

programs-text:
  At Code for Science & Society, we work across research, government, journalism, and new media to create innovative technology for the public good. Public spaces for data publishing, information sharing, and online collaboration are controlled by centralized systems that restrict the flow of information. Across industries, people are working to reimagine systems that allow ideas and data to flow freely, but these groups work in isolation. We create inclusive spaces that bring innovators together to share information and build together.

To advance our mission, we run three major programs. We develop open learning resources and facilitate collaborations and community-driven projects through our **Collaborative Communities** program. In our **Foundational Technology** program we develop open technology and shared resources with a focus on community owned initiatives and public interest technology. We nurture a network of innovative projects to enable communities learn from each other and develop future-facing solutions that empower people through a **Sponsored Projects** program.
