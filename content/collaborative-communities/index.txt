Our team has experience in starting, leading, funding, mentoring, and fiscally
sponsoring open source projects in the public interest. We offer programs and
services designed to elevate the ecosystem, including:

* Fiscal sponsorship bundled with strategic project support
* Services for projects that build management, leadership, and fundraising skills
* Services for funders focused on evaluating sustainability of investments in
open source to maximize impact
* Inclusive spaces for people to connect across domains and share knowledge
* Support for the development of diverse leaders

Work with us to support the growth and sustainability of open source projects and
give tomorrow’s leaders the tools they need. Here’s what participants are saying about our recent in-person workshop with Chan Zuckerberg Science Human Cell Atlas group:

> “Danielle Robinson + Joe Hand were amazing! I wished that everyone could go to this session to just talk about within-lab communication and project management.”

> “[Thanks] to inspiration from @joeahand and @daniellecrobins (+ other attendees) at the … GitHub session @cziscience Collaborative Computational Tools meeting .. I finally up'd my GitHub game .. guidelines, branches, PRs, squash-and-merges for a course we are teaching ..” - Mark Robinson via Twitter
